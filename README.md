# InternshipProject
Code for my portion of an internship with Prosper IT Consulting.
This is a recipe tracker web application using Python. 
It contains a database to store recipes and ingredients.
Integrated an API to pull recipes from the internet based on ingredients searched.
Utilized Beautiful Soup to scrape nutritional information from searched recipes.
Front-end designed with Bootstrap 4 as well as custom HTML and CSS.
Developed separate views for database CRUD functionality, as well as a view for data scraped using Beautiful soup.
Used Azure Devops for version control, and Slack for communicating with the scrum team.
